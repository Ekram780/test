	<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Ekram, I'm 16 years old. I'm in grade 12, finally my last year of highschool.It's been a long four years now it's coming to an end and I go to T.L Kennedy.I'm still not sure what I'm trying go into for my career I'm in a confusing stage right now on if I should become a teacher or something in the tech field. I enjoy tech because I token a course last year and I really liked it, and I was thinking about going into tech more that's why I decided to make that my career. I took this couse to see if it's something I actually want to go into since this is something to do with tech and also computer science was something I wanted to do in the future. </p>
